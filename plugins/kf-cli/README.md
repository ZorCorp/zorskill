# kf-cli — Obsidian Knowledge Capture for Claude Code & OpenClaw

A skill package that captures YouTube videos, articles, ideas, and GitHub repos into an Obsidian vault with AI auto-tagging. Publishes to GitHub Pages. No Docker. No MCP. Just CLI tools.

kf-cli is a **pure skill**: it exposes commands and templates only. Identity (who the agent is) and model choice (how it thinks) live in the agent or runtime that invokes the skill.

## Install

**Two paths, by invoker. Pick one — they are not interchangeable.**

### Option 1: Shell installer — for OpenClaw (and any agent framework that reads `~/.agents/skills/`)

Installs to `~/.agents/skills/kf-cli/`. OpenClaw and other agent runtimes that scan the agent-skill standard layout will pick it up automatically. Claude Code does **not** read this path — use Option 2 for Claude Code.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZorCorp/kf-cli/master/install.sh | bash
```

Update / uninstall:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZorCorp/kf-cli/master/install.sh | bash -s -- --update
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZorCorp/kf-cli/master/install.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall
```

### Option 2: Claude Code plugin marketplace — for Claude Code users

Claude Code discovers skills through its plugin manager, not through `~/.agents/skills/`. Run this inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin marketplace add ZorCorp/zorskill
/plugin install kf-cli
```

---

## Prerequisites

```bash
brew install yt-dlp gh jq uv
```

Verify: `yt-dlp --version && gh --version && jq --version && uvx --version`

---

## Configuration

The skill resolves the vault path at runtime:

1. `$KF_VAULT_PATH` environment variable (if set and contains `notes/`)
2. Current working directory (if it contains `notes/`)
3. `$HOME/Documents/Obsidian/myrag` (fallback default)

For publishing, run `/kf-cli:setup` inside your vault to create `.claude/config.local.json` with `sharehub_repo` and `sharehub_url`.

`/kf-cli:setup` also scaffolds the standard vault layout on first run — it creates `notes/`, `wiki/`, `raw/`, `output/`, `images/`, `Templates/` if missing, and seeds a starter `CLAUDE.md` (with the Capture → Wiki Rule + Tag → Topic mapping) plus `wiki/_master-index.md`. The seeding step is **non-destructive** — any existing `CLAUDE.md` or `_master-index.md` is preserved as-is.

Optional env vars:

| Var | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `KF_VAULT_PATH` | Vault root | `$HOME/Documents/Obsidian/myrag` |
| `SHAREHUB_URL` | Published base URL | (required for publish) |
| `KF_SHARE_BASE_URL` | Share-link base URL | `https://example.com/share` |
| `GEMINI_IMG_GEN_DIR` | Gemini image-generator skill dir | `$HOME/.claude/skills/gemini-image-generator` |

## Don't use Obsidian?

**kf-cli does not require Obsidian at runtime.** The "vault" is just a folder containing a `notes/` subdirectory; kf-cli writes plain Markdown files with YAML frontmatter that any editor (VS Code, Zed, Typora, `bat`, `glow`, plain `cat`) can read. No Obsidian app, plugin, or local REST API is called.

### First-run on a machine without Obsidian

The vault resolver (listed above) falls back to `$HOME/Documents/Obsidian/myrag` if `$KF_VAULT_PATH` is unset and the current directory has no `notes/` folder. On a non-Obsidian system that path usually doesn't exist, and the first capture command will error on a missing directory. Two clean fixes:

**Option 1 — point at any directory (recommended):**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/kf-vault/notes
export KF_VAULT_PATH=~/kf-vault
# add the export to your shell rc if you want it permanent
```

**Option 2 — materialize the default path:**

If you'd rather not set an env var, just create the default path kf-cli looks for:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/Obsidian/myrag/notes
```

kf-cli will then find the fallback and write notes into `~/Documents/Obsidian/myrag/notes/` — Obsidian does not need to be installed for this to work. (The path is named after Obsidian only because that's the author's personal layout; it is otherwise an ordinary folder.)

### What degrades without Obsidian (cosmetic, not functional)

Notes cross-link with `[[path/to/note|Title]]` wikilink syntax. Obsidian renders those as clickable links; most other Markdown viewers show them as literal text. Published output via `/kf-cli:publish` is unaffected — sharehub's Jekyll config converts wikilinks server-side.

## Optional: floating read-status button (Obsidian only)

Every kf-cli capture template writes `read: false` into frontmatter. That field is inert on its own — it only lights up if you also install the floating read-status button, a small Obsidian Templater startup script that injects a 📕 / 📖 toggle into the corner of every note and flips the `read:` flag with one click.

This is **optional** and **Obsidian-specific**. Skip it if you don't use Obsidian.

**Install:**

1. In Obsidian, install the [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) community plugin.
2. Copy the script into your vault's Templates folder:
   ```bash
   cp ~/.agents/skills/kf-cli/templates/floating-read-button-startup.md "$KF_VAULT_PATH/Templates/"
   # Claude Code users: replace ~/.agents/skills/kf-cli with the plugin install dir
   ```
3. In Obsidian → Settings → Templater → **Startup Templates**, add `Templates/floating-read-button-startup.md`.
4. Restart Obsidian. The button appears on any note whose frontmatter contains `read:` (all kf-cli notes qualify).

## Invocation patterns

- **Claude Code** — invoke commands as `/kf-cli:<command>`. The session's model handles all AI work.
- **OpenClaw, single-agent** — list `kf-cli` in one agent's allowed skills. That agent's configured model runs the commands.
- **OpenClaw, multi-agent** — list `kf-cli` on any agent that needs it. Each uses its own model.
- **Plain CLI** — `scripts/**/*.sh` is directly callable; `commands/*.md` are portable prompt templates any framework that reads Markdown skills can consume.

The model is always chosen by the invoker, never by the skill.
